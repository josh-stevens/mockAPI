# Mock API Creator
This package will launch a minimalistic local API that can be used to create mock responses for a front end application to consume.

## Getting Started
First, clone the repo and run `npm install`. When the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` from the package's root directory. This will launch a server listening on port 8080.
